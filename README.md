# Welcome to `operato`!

September 2022 is a month to remember (well at least if you get excited about
advanced numerical simulation).  The reason is that
[Altair](https://www.altair.com) announced the immediate availability in the
opensource domain of their explicit finite element code Radioss (re-branded to
[OpenRadioss](https://www.openradioss.org)). Now it is up to the community to
start adding useful new features and hopefully `operato` is one of them.

# So what is `operato`?
`operato` is a set of tools and utilities that support the use of OpenRadioss.
I currently have two tools in mind:
 - A Python package to facilitate the programmatic generation of starter
   and engine files.
 - A conversion tool for the conversion of OpenRadioss `.h3d` files to any of
   the VTK file formats.
